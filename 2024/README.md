# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Here are my solutions (work in progress) for the 2024 AoC. I am attempting to
solve them all in go, to upskill myself in golang

## Usage

To run a particular day use:

`go run main.go -d <challenge_number> -p <part>`

To run all solutions use:

`go run main.go --runall`
